\fs36 \cf0 First lets talk about testing my file that I have made, in the file first I ran the CHOMPAPP. Then use the USB-IP to attach a virtual drive and then after attaching a virtual drive I ran my CHOMP DRIVE which is the executable file that acted as the USB-DRIVER. And, for testing I used the JS Test. And, my testing went successfully.\
\
At the program part, at line 129 i.e. the main part of the program, that shows how we start our program by setting up the input device. Line 21 will tell us about how we set up and simultaneously moving to the line 62, which tells about the how we closed it. \
\
Once, we initialize the USB-library and open the device using PID, we do the error checking to make sure nothing went wrong and after this the code shows us about the different states the CHOMPAPP can take and how we store them.\
In the while loop, it will run until there is a user input following which the input is stored and state is changed and once we interrupt, the while loop is executed. At line 72, which tells us about emitting the state after taking all the user input. And, at last line 86 will tell how various inputs by the user has been processed.\
